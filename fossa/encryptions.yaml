        # Explain how the encryption is used
      - usage: "ACM Runtime uses SIP-TLS encryption when communicating outside the mesh to Postgres."
        # Encryption Purpose (possible values: 'Data confidentiality, OAM only', 'Data confidentiality, not only OAM', 'Other than data confidentiality')
        purpose: 'Data confidentiality, OAM only'
        # Encryption Protocols
        protocols:
          - protocol: SSL
            usage: "ACMR supports use of SSL protocol for encrypted communication."
            standard: "IETF"
          - protocol: TLS 1.3
            usage: "As part of the SSL Standard, ACRM supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encrypted communication."
